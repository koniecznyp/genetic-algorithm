# genetic-algorithm
Simple implementation of the genetic algorithm to solve a given function. The program was created during classes at the university. The program defines parameters that can be changed depending on the needs. The basic program parameters with default values are described below.

```sh
POPULATION_SIZE 16      - determines how large the population should be
BITS 32                 - chromosome size
P_m 0.1                 - mutation probability
P_c 0.9                 - crossover probability
LOOPS 5000              - iterations
THREADS 8               - total number of threads used for parallel calculations
```

Hint: The calculations are best done in Release mode because it will allow additional optimizations and will have a positive effect on the result
